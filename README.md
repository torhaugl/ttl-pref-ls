ttl-pref-ls
===========

A lightweight **Language Server for Turtle (`*.ttl`) files** that replaces
opaque UUID-style IRIs with their human-friendly `skos:prefLabel`s inside
Neovim. Hovering over any IRI defined in the same file shows its label; missing
labels are flagged as diagnostics. This language server also supports inlay
hints.

## Install

Install as a python package, e.g.,
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/torhaugl/ttl-pref-ls.git
```
Ideally, install it with `pipx` so that the command is always available, even
from virtual environments.

## Neovim setup

As of Neovim 0.11, language servers can be configured by making a file
`.config/nvim/lsp/ttl_pref_ls.lua` with this snippet inside:
```lua
return {
  cmd = { 'ttl-pref-ls' },
  filetypes = { 'turtle' },
}
```
In addition, you can enable your Neovim to start the LSP whenerver it enters a
`.nt` file with this snippet in your `init.lua` or equivalent:
```lua
vim.lsp.enable { 'nt_pref_ls' }
```

The hover functionality is accessed with 'K' in Normal mode by default. In
addition, it is useful to add keybinds to enable hints or virtual lines:
```lua
-- Toggle virtual hints and lines
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>th', function()
  vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable(not vim.lsp.inlay_hint.is_enabled { bufnr = 0 })
end, { desc = '[T]oggle Inlay [H]ints' })

vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>tv', function()
  local current = vim.diagnostic.config().virtual_lines
  vim.diagnostic.config { virtual_lines = not current }
end, { desc = '[T]oggle [V]irtual Lines' })

```

## Example

Hover tooltips and inline inlayâ€‘hints for two labelled UUID IRIs; the
unlabelled one is underlined as a Hint diagnostic.
Inlay hints show up next to the IRI with the prefLabel.

The functionality also works with external prefixes, as long as there is an
internet connection. This is very useful for ontologies that uses UUIDs for
URIs like [EMMO](http://www.w3id.org/emmo#).
